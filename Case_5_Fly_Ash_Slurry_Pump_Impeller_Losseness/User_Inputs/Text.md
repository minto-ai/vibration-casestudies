I'am observing a lot of vibrations in the Induction motor driven pump and having difficulty identifying the exact fault in Pump.

I need your help in consolidating the observations and pointing it to fault precisely.

The pump is a single-stage, horizontal, centrifugal, double-case pump directly coupled with Induction motor, designed for pumping ash slurry with a maximum specific gravity of 1.6. The flow passage parts of the pump are made from a wear-resistant alloy. The pump's rating includes a head of 67 MWC and a discharge capacity of 1800 mÂ³/hr. The pump is equipped with bearings specifically chosen for their load-bearing capabilities: the DE (motor end) bearing is a double row spherical roller bearing, model 22236 CC/W33, designed for radial loads, while the NDE bearing, model 22332 CC/W33, is designed for thrust loads. The pump has an Impeller with 4 Vanes and is driven by a motor with a rating of 825 kW, 6.6 kV, 725 rpm, and is a three-phase, 50 Hz induction motor.

Vibration signatures from the pump bearing were recorded in both horizontal and vertical directions. These signatures showed a dominant 2x rpm component and high-frequency harmonic components.

The Pump NDE bearing spectra revealed high-frequency vibrations, accounting for more than 50% of the radial component along with the 4x rpm component being particularly prominent.

Additionally, the Pump DE bearing exhibited significant 2x and higher harmonics in Radial as well as Axial. In fact an excessively high axial vibration was observed at the pump DE bearing, measuring 23 mm/sec peak, with the 2x rpm component being the most dominant, reaching 18 mm/sec peak.

No Data Recorded at Motor DE and NDE. I have Attached the Displacement/Velocity measurements in the table.

What is the root cause?
