### Vignette for Vibration Issues in Exhauster Unit 1

**Root Cause:** Residual unbalance and misalignment in motor/coupler/fan assembly

**Observations from Different Positions of the Motor and Fan**

**Motor Drive End (MDE) Bearing:**

- **Horizontal Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 0.17 (1x RPM), 0.15 (2x RPM), 0.12 (3x RPM)

- **Vertical Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 0.16 (1x RPM), 0.05 (2x RPM), 0.04 (3x RPM)

**Fan Drive End (FDE) Bearing:**

- **Horizontal Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 0.14 (1x RPM), 0.02 (2x RPM), 0.02 (3x RPM)

- **Vertical Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 0.06 (1x RPM), 0.02 (2x RPM), 0.01 (3x RPM)
  - Presence of low-frequency (sub-1Hz) vibrations

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

**Vibration Signatures:**
- **Motor DE and Fan DE Bearing Spectra:** Dominant 1x frequency vibrations indicate unbalance and misalignment.
- **Low-Frequency Vibrations:** Sub-1Hz vibrations in the Z-axis suggest changes in lateral stiffness of the shaft.

**Potential Causes:**
- **Residual Unbalance:** Indicated by dominant 1x frequencies.
- **Misalignment:** Suggested by higher axial vibrations in the Z-axis.
- **Thermal Gradients:** Differential thermal gradients across the coupling.
- **Coupling Degradation:** Possible depletion of the coupling unit's visco-elastic properties.

**Conclusion:**
Residual unbalance, misalignment, thermal gradients, and coupling degradation were identified as the root causes of high vibration levels.

**Best Possible Help:**

To address the issue and prevent recurrence, the following steps were taken:

- **Replacement:** Inspect and replace necessary components of the coupling set.
- **Alignment:** Perform precise alignment between the motor and fan.
- **Balancing:** Conduct multi-plane balancing of the fan and motor assembly.
- **Thermal Checks:** Perform cold start cycles to check the impact of thermal gradients.
- **Post-Maintenance Verification:** Test vibration levels across the unit after maintenance.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement regular vibration monitoring to detect early signs of faults.

By following these steps, the vibration issue was resolved, significantly improving the operational reliability of Exhauster Unit 1.
