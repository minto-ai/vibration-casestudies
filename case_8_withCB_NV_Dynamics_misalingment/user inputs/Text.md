graphs, tables and vibration data are attached.

Tri-axial accelerometers were mounted at DE & NDE side of the motor bearing housing and DE & NDE of the impeller fan. The accelerometers were then connected to a multi -channel data acquisition system.

The drive system containing the synchronous motor, pin bush type coupler and the impeller fan were run at the operating speed with load and were recorded for about 5 minutes continuously on the data acquisition system.
- Operating speed: 17Hz
- Number of poles: 6
- Supply frequency: 50 Hz
Additionally, run up and run down conditions of the system were recorded continuously for both the exhauster units to check for any critical speeds that are likely to be influencing the vibration response.

The Acceleration vs time graphs are both cold runs

I am investigating root cause minor misalignment found in this motor
