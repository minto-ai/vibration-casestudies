# Vignette for looseness in motor internals and coupling, and locked up coupling of a horizontal centrifugal pump set

**Root Cause:** pump half coupling and looseness in motor bearing housing

**Observations from Different Positions of the pump set**

**Vibration data of the pump set:**
  **1:**
- **Horizontal Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 4.2-7 (1x RPM), 2.4-2.8 (2x RPM),
- **Vertical Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 15 (1x RPM), 3.4 (2x RPM), 1.8 (3x RPM) 
- **Axial Direction:**  
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 25 (1x RPM), 1 (2x RPM), 1 (3x RPM)

**2:**

- **Horizontal Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 11 (1x RPM), 2.6-3.4 (2x RPM), 1.4 (3x RPM)
- **Vertical Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 31 (1x RPM), 2.2 (2x RPM), 2.2 (3x RPM)
- **Axial Direction:**  
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 34 (1x RPM)

**3:**    
- **Horizontal Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 3.6 (1x RPM), 2.3 (3x RPM)
- **Vertical Direction:**
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 1.5-2.4 (1x RPM), 2 (3x RPM)
- **Axial Direction:**  
  - Vibration velocity values (mm/s): 0.7-1.6 (1x RPM), 1-1.3 (2x RPM), 2 (3x RPM)

  

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

**Vibration Signatures:**
- **Motor bearings and housing:** the higher harmonics indicated likelihood of mechanical looseness 
- **High Vibrations levels:** high vibrations were found on the motor bearing vertical and axial , high axial push

**Potential Causes:**
- **looseness in motor bearing housing:** Increased clearance between bearing and hosuing caused eccentricity.
- **Coupling :** The axial runout is higher 
- **Mechanical looseness:** 2X and higher harmonics indicate mechanical looseness 

**Conclusion:**
- looseness in the motor bearing housing and pump half coupling were detected as the faults
**Best Possible Help:**

To address the issue and prevent , the following steps were taken:

- **Replacement:** Inspect and replace bearings.
- **Coupling check :** Check the coupling between pump and motor 
- **Clearance:** Conduct a clearance of Motor bearing housing
- **Post-Maintenance Verification:** Test vibration levels across the unit after maintenance.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement regular vibration monitoring to detect early signs of faults.

By following these steps, the vibration issue was resolved, significantly improving the centrifugal pump set.
