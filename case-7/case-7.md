# Vignette for Coupling Damage in Crude Oil Stripper Pump

**Root Cause:** Damaged and worn out coupling between motor and pump

### Observations from Different Positions of the Motor and Pump

1. **Pump Drive End (PDE) Bearing:**
    - **Horizontal Direction:**
        - High vibration level of 12.6 mm/s RMS before maintenance
        - Dominant 2X and 3X rotational frequencies observed
    - **Vertical Direction:**
        - High vibration level of 9.7 mm/s RMS before maintenance
        - Dominant 2X and 3X rotational frequencies observed
2. **Motor Drive End (MDE) Bearing:**
    - **Vertical Direction:**
        - Elevated vibration level of 6.0 mm/s RMS before maintenance
        - Dominant 2X and 3X rotational frequencies observed

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

1. **Vibration Signatures:**
    - **PDE and MDE Bearing Spectra:** The vibration spectra recorded in both horizontal and vertical directions exhibited dominant 2X and 3X rotational frequencies. This indicates an issue related to misalignment and coupling problems.
    - **Cross Channel Phase Readings:** These readings confirmed misalignment of the equipment.
2. **Potential Causes:**
    - **Coupling Damage:** The presence of dominant 2X and 3X frequencies strongly suggested coupling issues.
    - **Misalignment:** Cross channel phase readings indicated misalignment between the motor and pump.
3. **Inspection Findings:**
    - **Coupling Inspection:** Physical inspection revealed that the coupling was broken and completely worn out.
4. **Conclusion:**
    - The damaged and worn out coupling was the root cause of the high vibration levels. This was confirmed by the vibration analysis and physical inspection.

**What is the Best Possible Help:**

To address the issue and prevent recurrence, the following steps were taken:

- **Replacement:** The damaged coupling set was replaced with a new one.
- **Pump Replacement:** The pump was replaced with a refurbished one.
- **Alignment:** Precise alignment was carried out between the motor and pump.
- **Post-Maintenance Verification:** Vibration levels were tested across the unit after maintenance, showing significant reduction (up to 89% less vibration in some points).
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement regular vibration monitoring to detect early signs of similar faults and prevent recurrence.

By following these steps, the vibration issue was resolved, and the crude oil stripper pump's reliability and operational efficiency were improved.


## Here's a summary of facts for each fault, including looseness types, misalignment, and unbalance:

1. Unbalance:
- Causes vibration at 1X RPM frequency.
- Amplitude increases with the square of speed below first rotor critical.
- Approximately 0° phase difference between outboard and inboard horizontals, and between outboard and inboard verticals.
- Approximately 90° phase difference between horizontal & vertical readings on each bearing (±30°).

2. Misalignment:
- Angular Misalignment: High axial vibration, 180° out-of-phase across coupling. Typically has high 1X and 2X RPM.
- Parallel Misalignment: High radial vibration, 180° out-of-phase across coupling. 2X often larger than 1X.
- Both types can generate high amplitude peaks at higher harmonics (4X-8X) when severe.

3. Looseness:
Type A:
- Caused by structural looseness/weakness of machine feet, baseplate or foundation.
- Phase analysis may reveal 90° - 180° phase difference between vertical measurements.

Type B:
- Caused by loose pillow block bolts, cracks in frame structure or bearing pedestal.
- Generates multiple harmonics of running speed.

Type C:
- Caused by improper fit between component parts.
- Causes truncation of time waveform and raised noise floor in spectrum.
- Phase often unstable and may vary widely.
- Can cause subharmonic multiples at 1/2 or 1/3 RPM.

4. Bent Shaft:
- Causes high axial vibration with 180° phase differences on same machine component.
- Dominant vibration at 1X if bent near shaft center, 2X if bent near coupling.
