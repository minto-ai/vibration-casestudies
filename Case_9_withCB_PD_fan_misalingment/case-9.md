**Diagnosis Explanation:**

**Vibration Signatures:**
- **Dominant Frequencies:** Dominant 1X, 3X, and 6X frequencies indicating misalignment and coupling issues.
- **Cross Phase Analysis:** Readings found out of phase (179 degrees) in axial direction at Motor DE to Fan DE bearing, indicating angular misalignment.

**Potential Causes:**
- **Misalignment:** Confirmed by cross-phase analysis showing out of phase readings.
- **Coupling Issues:** Higher axial vibrations due to potential issues with the coupling.

**Conclusion:**
Misalignment and coupling degradation were identified as the root causes of high vibration levels, particularly in the axial direction.

**Best Possible Help:**

To address the issue and prevent recurrence, the following steps were recommended:

1. **Check the coupling gap as per OEM specifications.**
2. **Review and correct the alignment between the drive and driven components.**
3. **If vibration levels do not reduce, conduct dynamic balancing.**
4. **Note:** Due to coupling issues, vibration values are on the higher side, leading to increased axial vibrations.

By following these steps, the vibration issue can be resolved, improving the operational reliability of PD FAN-2.
