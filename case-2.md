# Vignette for Discharge Pipeline Vibrations in Seal Air Fan System

**Root Cause:** Excessive vibrations in the discharge pipeline during Raw mill operation

### Observations from Different Operating Conditions

1. **Raw Mill Operating:**
    - Very high pipe vibrations observed in the discharge pipeline
    - Elevated vibration values detected in the seal air fan
2. **Raw Mill Stopped:**
    - Significant drop in vibration values
    - Absence of pipe vibrations

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

1. **Vibration Patterns:**
    - **High Vibrations During Operation:** The seal air fan system experiences very high pipe vibrations and elevated vibration values when the Raw mill is operating.
    - **Low Vibrations When Stopped:** A significant reduction in vibration levels is observed when the Raw mill is not in operation.
2. **Potential Causes:**
    - **Pipeline Support Issues:** Inadequate or loose supports and hangers along the discharge pipeline could be contributing to the vibrations.
    - **Damper or Bellows Problems:** Faulty dampers or bellows in the system may fail to properly control or isolate vibrations.
    - **Flow-Induced Vibrations:** The operation of the Raw mill likely causes changes in airflow that induce vibrations in the pipeline.
    - **Possible Obstructions:** Foreign objects or obstructions in the fan or pipe system could cause imbalance or interference, leading to vibrations.
3. **System Interaction:**
    - The strong correlation between Raw mill operation and vibration levels indicates a direct relationship between the mill's operation and the pipeline's dynamic response.

**What is the Best Possible Help:**

To address the issue and improve system stability, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Inspect and Reinforce Supports:** Thoroughly inspect the supports and hangers along the entire discharge pipe. Look for obstructions, loose supports, or misalignments. Reinforce or replace supports as necessary.

2. **Damper and Bellows Inspection:** Inspect the damper and bellows for proper operation. Repair or replace these components if found to be faulty.

3. **System Cleaning and Inspection:** Ensure there are no obstructions or foreign objects in the fan or pipe system that could cause imbalance or interference.

4. **Vibration Analysis:** Conduct a detailed vibration analysis during both operating and non-operating conditions to pinpoint specific problem areas in the pipeline.

5. **Flow Analysis:** Consider performing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to understand the airflow patterns and potential flow-induced vibration sources.

6. **Structural Modifications:** Based on the analysis results, consider implementing structural modifications such as adding stiffeners or vibration dampeners to the pipeline.

7. **Operational Procedures:** Develop and implement procedures for gradual startup and shutdown of the Raw mill to minimize sudden changes in system dynamics.

## Here's a summary of facts for each fault:

Unbalance:

- Unbalance typically shows a predominant 1X RPM peak in the spectrum.
- Force unbalance causes in-phase and steady vibration.
- Amplitude due to unbalance increases by the square of speed below first rotor critical.
- Unbalance typically causes high radial vibrations.
- Causes vibration at 1X RPM frequency.
- Amplitude increases with the square of speed below first rotor critical.
- Approximately 0° phase difference between outboard and inboard horizontals, and between outboard and inboard verticals.
- Approximately 90° phase difference between horizontal & vertical readings on each bearing (±30°).

Looseness:
Type A:
- Caused by structural looseness/weakness of machine feet, baseplate or foundation.
- Phase analysis may reveal 90° - 180° phase difference between vertical measurements.

Type B : 
Looseness can generate multiple harmonics of running speed in the spectrum.
- Caused by loose pillow block bolts, cracks in frame structure or bearing pedestal.
- Generates multiple harmonics of running speed.
Type C :
Looseness can cause subharmonic multiples at exactly 1/2 or 1/3 RPM (.5X, 1.5X, 2.5X, etc.).
Looseness can be highly directional.
- Caused by improper fit between component parts.
- Causes truncation of time waveform and raised noise floor in spectrum.
- Phase often unstable and may vary widely.
- Can cause subharmonic multiples at 1/2 or 1/3 RPM.
Type C Looseness causes a truncation of time waveform and a raised noise floor in the spectrum.

Misalignment:

- Angular misalignment typically shows high 1X and 2X RPM, but 3X can also dominate.
- Parallel misalignment often shows 2X RPM larger than 1X, but depends on coupling type.
- Severe misalignment can generate high amplitude peaks at 4X-8X or higher harmonics.
- Angular Misalignment: High axial vibration, 180° out-of-phase across coupling. Typically has high 1X and 2X RPM.
- Parallel Misalignment: High radial vibration, 180° out-of-phase across coupling. 2X often larger than 1X.
- Both types can generate high amplitude peaks at higher harmonics (4X-8X) when severe.

Bent Shaft:
- Causes high axial vibration with 180° phase differences on same machine component.
- Dominant vibration at 1X if bent near shaft center, 2X if bent near coupling.

Based on these facts, your analysis seems more aligned with the symptoms you've described (3X dominance and its harmonics). Your recommendations for close monitoring, inspecting bearings, checking alignment, and ensuring proper machine base support are appropriate steps given the possibility of looseness or misalignment.
