Visual Inspection

High vibrations are observed at particular RPM's

Analysis Objective: Spectrum Symptoms:

At Motor

Horizontal: 1X Harmonics up to 10X and Predominant is 3X and there is a 1.5X Harmonics and there is a peaks at 6893.46, 7950.12 RPM with low amplitude

Vertical: 1X Harmonics, Predominant is 6X, and there is a peaks at 6893.46, 7950.12 RPM with low amplitude

Axial: 1X Harmonics, Predominant is 6X, and there is a peaks at 6893.46, 7950.12, 9031.98 RPM with low amplitude

At Fan

Horizontal: 1X Harmonics up to 10X and Predominant is 3X and there is a peaks at 4779.8, 7950.12 RPM with low amplitude

Vertical: 1X Harmonics up to 10X and Predominant is 3X and there is a peaks at 4779.8, 7950.12 RPM with low amplitude

Axial: 1X Harmonics, Predominant is 3X, but there is no 1X & 2X. there is a peak at 4779.8 and its harmonics and also some random peaks at Higher orders.

At Fan NDE

Horizontal: 3X Harmonics

Vertical : 3X dominant, There is no 1x & 2x, and there is a peak at 4235.7, 4737,4812.1, 5313.48

We don't have the Phase readings, Tell me your analysis

Feedback:
The primary fault identified is Unbalance (Ub). This conclusion is supported by the predominant 1X harmonics and high radial vibrations observed in both the motor and fan. This was given BY AI but

The primary symptom identified, 1X harmonics, is related to bearing rotational looseness. The data provided is 3X dominance and its harmonics,  the problem may not be unbalance. 
Based on my analysis:
1. Close monitoring is required.
2. Proper support for the machine base should be provided.
3. Inspect the motor bearings for clearances, and make the necessary corrections.
4. Inspect the fan bearings for looseness with the shaft/housing; if found loose, then replace the bearings and repair the housing/shaft.
5. Cross-check the alignment readings

Please review it and correct me if I am wrong.
