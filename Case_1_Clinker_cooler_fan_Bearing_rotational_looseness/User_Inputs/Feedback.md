The primary fault identified is Unbalance (Ub). This conclusion is supported by the predominant 1X harmonics and high radial vibrations observed in both the motor and fan. This was given BY AI but

The primary symptom identified, 1X harmonics, is related to bearing rotational looseness. The data provided is 3X dominance and its harmonics,  the problem may not be unbalance. 
Based on my analysis:
1. Close monitoring is required.
2. Proper support for the machine base should be provided.
3. Inspect the motor bearings for clearances, and make the necessary corrections.
4. Inspect the fan bearings for looseness with the shaft/housing; if found loose, then replace the bearings and repair the housing/shaft.
5. Cross-check the alignment readings

Please review it and correct me if I am wrong.
