in a chemical processing plant, a critical gas recycle fan powered by a 4-pole squirrel cage induction motor, directly coupled to the fan, undergoes monthly vibration monitoring. In March 2024, an increase in vibration levels was observed in the 3 to 4X RPM Band on the motor's non-drive end (NDE) horizontal reading. Assistance is needed to diagnose the fault.

Machine Details:

Power: 315 KW

Rated Speed: 1500 RPM

Actual Running Speed: 1490 RPM

Poles: 4

Bearings: Rolling element type

Observations:

Harmonics of Motor Running speed from 1X to 8X.

High-resolution spectrum shows run speed harmonics surrounded by modulation sidebands.

Sidebands measured at 40 CPM (Cycles Per Minute).

Extended time waveform clearly shows a regular “beat” is present, which was audible.
