# Vignette for Bearing Rotational Looseness in Motor and Fan Assembly

**Root Cause:** Bearing rotational looseness in motor and/or fan bearings

### Observations from Different Positions of the Motor and Fan

1. **Motor Bearings:**
    - Dominant 3X vibration frequency and its harmonics observed
    - High radial vibrations detected
2. **Fan Bearings:**
    - Dominant 3X vibration frequency and its harmonics observed
    - High radial vibrations detected

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

1. **Vibration Signatures:**
    - **3X Dominance:** The presence of dominant 3X frequency and its harmonics in both motor and fan bearings is indicative of bearing rotational looseness, not unbalance as initially suggested.
    - **High Radial Vibrations:** This supports the presence of a mechanical issue, likely related to the bearing looseness.
2. **Potential Causes:**
    - **Bearing Rotational Looseness:** The 3X dominance strongly suggests looseness in the bearings, either in the motor, fan, or both.
    - **Possible Base Support Issues:** High vibrations could also indicate inadequate support for the machine base.
3. **Incorrect Initial Diagnosis:**
    - The initial AI diagnosis of unbalance based on presumed 1X harmonics was incorrect. The actual data showing 3X dominance points to bearing rotational looseness rather than unbalance.

**What is the Best Possible Help:**

To address the issue and confirm the diagnosis, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Close Monitoring:** Implement continuous vibration monitoring to track the progression of the issue.
2. **Improve Base Support:** Provide proper support for the machine base to reduce overall vibration.
3. **Motor Bearing Inspection:** Inspect the motor bearings for clearances and make necessary corrections.
4. **Fan Bearing Inspection:** Check the fan bearings for looseness with the shaft/housing. If loose, replace the bearings and repair the housing/shaft as needed.
5. **Alignment Verification:** Cross-check the alignment readings to ensure proper alignment between components.
6. **Further Analysis:** If these steps don't resolve the issue, consider additional diagnostic techniques to rule out other potential causes.

By following these steps, the root cause of the vibration can be confirmed and addressed, improving the reliability and operational efficiency of the motor and fan assembly.

## Here's a summary of facts for each fault, including looseness types, misalignment, and unbalance:

Unbalance:

Unbalance typically shows a predominant 1X RPM peak in the spectrum.
Force unbalance causes in-phase and steady vibration.
Amplitude due to unbalance increases by the square of speed below first rotor critical.
Unbalance typically causes high radial vibrations.

Looseness:

Type B Looseness can generate multiple harmonics of running speed in the spectrum.
Type C Looseness can cause subharmonic multiples at exactly 1/2 or 1/3 RPM (.5X, 1.5X, 2.5X, etc.).
Looseness can be highly directional.
Type C Looseness causes a truncation of time waveform and a raised noise floor in the spectrum.

Misalignment:

Angular misalignment typically shows high 1X and 2X RPM, but 3X can also dominate.
Parallel misalignment often shows 2X RPM larger than 1X, but depends on coupling type.
Severe misalignment can generate high amplitude peaks at 4X-8X or higher harmonics.

Based on these facts, your analysis seems more aligned with the symptoms you've described (3X dominance and its harmonics). Your recommendations for close monitoring, inspecting bearings, checking alignment, and ensuring proper machine base support are appropriate steps given the possibility of looseness or misalignment.
