**Root Cause:** High vertical vibration levels in the motor DE and NDE caused by structural or installation issues.

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

The centrifugal fan, handling cold air, is equipped with an impeller mounted directly on the motor shaft. The motor specifications are 90 KW, 2965 RPM, 415V, and 50 Hz, with SKF 6319 and NU 316 ECP bearings for the DE and NDE sides, respectively. Since commissioning, the fan exhibited slight rough vibrations, which gradually increased.

**Vibration Observations:**

- **Vibration Frequency:** The entire vibration was occurring at 1x RPM, initially suggesting unbalance. However, the vertical vibration levels at the motor bearings were significantly higher than the horizontal levels, indicating that unbalance was not the root cause.
- **Phase Analysis:** The phase difference between horizontal and vertical at the outboard bearing was 113째, while at the inboard bearing it was 180째. This directional vibration pattern would not occur in simple unbalance. Moreover, the phase difference between horizontal directions was 90째, and between vertical directions was 157째, further confirming that unbalance was not the primary cause.

The higher vertical vibrations compared to horizontal ones, combined with phase analysis showing inconsistent phase differences, suggested that simple unbalance was not the root cause. Without additional findings, the exact cause of the vertical vibration levels cannot be definitively identified. However, these observations indicated that structural or installation issues might be involved, and further investigation was needed.

**What is the best possible help:**

**Recommended Actions for Further Confirmation:**

- Perform phase analysis at the base plate to confirm the presence of any soft-foot conditions or structural issues.

By implementing these steps, the maintenance team can confirm the diagnosis, address the root cause, and prevent future occurrences with minimal effort.

**Profile Summary:**

- **Machine:** Centrifugal fan in a cold air handling application
- **Fault:** Excessive vertical vibration levels indicating potential structural or installation issues.
- **User Action:** Maintenance team should perform phase analysis at the base plate, inspect and reinforce the base frame, monitor vibration levels, and conduct regular phase analysis to ensure proper anchorage and prevent future issues.

By following these steps, the diagnosis can be investigated further, the root cause addressed, and future occurrences prevented, ensuring continued reliable operation of the seal air fan."
