# Vignette for Fan Bearing Looseness and Housing Damage

**Root Cause:** Bearing looseness in housing and housing damage

### Observations from Different Positions of the Fan

1. **Drive End (DE) Bearing:**
    - Bearing found loose in housing
2. **Non-Drive End (NDE) Bearing:**
    - Heavy pitting found in bottom cover of housing

**Diagnosis Explanation:**

1. **Bearing Conditions:**
    - **DE Bearing Looseness:** The drive end bearing was found to be loose in its housing. This condition can lead to increased vibration, potential misalignment, and accelerated wear of both the bearing and the housing.
    - **NDE Bearing Housing Damage:** Heavy pitting in the bottom cover of the non-drive end bearing housing indicates significant material degradation. This could be due to corrosion, erosion, or fatigue over time.
2. **Potential Causes:**
    - **Improper Installation:** The DE bearing looseness could be a result of improper installation or inadequate tightening during previous maintenance.
    - **Wear and Tear:** Normal wear over time could have contributed to the loosening of the DE bearing.
    - **Environmental Factors:** The pitting in the NDE bearing housing might be due to exposure to corrosive elements or moisture.
    - **Vibration:** Prolonged exposure to high vibration levels could have accelerated the wear on both bearings and housings.
3. **System Impact:**
    - These bearing and housing issues likely resulted in increased vibration levels, reduced efficiency, and potential risk of further damage to the fan system if left unaddressed.

**What is the Best Possible Help:**

To address the issues and prevent recurrence, the following actions were taken:

1. **Complete Replacement:** Both fan bearings along with their housings were replaced with new ones. This comprehensive approach ensures:
   - Elimination of the looseness issue in the DE bearing
   - Removal of the damaged housing for the NDE bearing
   - A fresh start with properly fitted components

2. **Recommended Follow-up Actions:**
   - **Alignment Check:** Perform precision alignment of the fan after the bearing and housing replacement.
   - **Vibration Analysis:** Conduct post-replacement vibration analysis to ensure proper installation and operation.
   - **Root Cause Investigation:** Investigate the causes of the pitting in the NDE bearing housing to prevent similar issues in the future.
   - **Maintenance Schedule Review:** Revise the preventive maintenance schedule to include regular bearing inspections and housing condition assessments.
   - **Environmental Control:** If environmental factors contributed to the housing damage, implement measures to protect the bearings and housings from corrosive elements or moisture.

By replacing both bearings and housings and implementing these follow-up actions, the fan's reliability and operational efficiency should be significantly improved, reducing the risk of unexpected failures and extended downtime.

# Facts: 

    **Looseness Type C (Lc)**
    - **FG:** **Sub-Synchronous, Synchronous & Harmonic [F_G_4]**
    - **D_D_R:** Radial and/or Axial (H, V, A)
    - **Technique:** Time Waveform
    - **Mathematical Formula Wrt to (m, n, k):** \( f = \frac{1}{n} \times \text{RPM} \) (where \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \))
    - **Rules of Thumb:** N/A
    - **Phase Characteristics:** 
    - Phase measurements are generally unstable.
    - If the vibration becomes highly directional, the difference between horizontal and vertical directions will be close to 0째 or 180째.
    - **Differentiator:**
    - Type C is often caused by a loose bearing liner in its cap, excessive clearance in either a sleeve or rolling element bearing, or a loose impeller on a shaft.
    - The spectrum includes several peaks at various frequencies, indicating a complex vibration pattern.
    - The spectrum may show subharmonic multiples at exactly 0.5x, 1.5x, 2.5x, etc.
    - Amplitude is shown at multiple harmonics of the rotational speed, indicating a complex vibration pattern with significant energy at many multiples of the fundamental frequency.
    - The vibration spectrum may display many harmonics up to 10x or even 20x the rotational frequency.
    - This type of looseness tends to produce highly directional vibration with relatively high amplitude.
    - Presence of a distinct 0.5x peak suggests a more complex loosening issue, possibly involving friction.

    Misalignment:

    - Angular misalignment typically shows high 1X and 2X RPM, but 3X can also dominate.
    - Parallel misalignment often shows 2X RPM larger than 1X, but depends on coupling type.
    - Severe misalignment can generate high amplitude peaks at 4X-8X or higher harmonics.
    - Angular Misalignment: High axial vibration, 180째 out-of-phase across coupling. Typically has high 1X and 2X RPM.
    - Parallel Misalignment: High radial vibration, 180째 out-of-phase across coupling. 2X often larger than 1X.
    - Both types can generate high amplitude peaks at higher harmonics (4X-8X) when severe.
