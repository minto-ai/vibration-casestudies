Machine Name: CRUDE OIL STRIPPER PUMP
Description
Motor – Coupling -Pump
Rated RPM - 2956
Motor Rating - 110KW
Coupling Type - Shim Packed Coupling

Initial Findings:
- Our team of engineers acquired vibration data with high resolution spectrums to detect the cause of high vibration in motor and pump. The spectrum shows that 2X, 3X rotational frequency is dominant on motor and pump bearing. I have attached the Table with vibration reads at different points of the machine
